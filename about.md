My name is Long Nguyen. I am a software engineer with a mechanical engineering background from Caltech.

A few of my projects include King of Tokyo (online version), Meet-n-rec (App for organizing recreational meetup) etc.

I focus on React/Redux, Node/Express and PostgreSQL but also use other framework and technology such as Angular 2, mySQL etc..
